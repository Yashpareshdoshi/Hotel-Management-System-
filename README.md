# Hotel-Management-System-
A Java-based Hotel Management System with SQL backend designed to simplify hotel operations such as room booking, customer check-in/check-out, billing, and staff management.   This project replaces manual queries with an interactive interface where buttons trigger automated SQL operations, making it more user-friendly and efficient.
